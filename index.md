### Todo



![Todo UI](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/34fde8a6ffd69d3da1087f1e3829ad11093e6d20/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e70696e672e6c6f6c2f66696c6575706c6f6164732f546f446f4170705f323031372d31322d33315f30322d33392d35382e706e67)

Todo is a simple Kanban app created in C# with WPF. It supports drag and drop for the items, and supports as many different columns as is wished.  

Kanban project files are saved in a .todo file format, but does support reading and saving in other formats as well, such as .txt, as long as the format of the JSON content in it is correct.
